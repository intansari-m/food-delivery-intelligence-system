## 🚀 Project Overview

The food delivery industry is one of the most competitive and operationally complex ecosystems today.  
Customers expect:

- ⏱ Fast delivery  
- 📍 Accurate ETA prediction  
- ⭐ Consistent service quality  

Even small delivery delays can result in:

- Increased refund & compensation cost  
- Lower app ratings  
- Reduced customer retention  
- Brand trust erosion  

Traditional dashboards are **reactive** — they explain what already happened.  
This system is designed to be **predictive and strategic**, helping organizations **anticipate delivery risks before they occur**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict food delivery time using supervised machine learning  
- Identify primary operational delay drivers  
- Quantify traffic and weather impact  
- Enable scenario-based ETA simulation  
- Provide strategic logistics recommendations  
- Deliver an interactive executive-grade intelligence dashboard  

The objective is not only prediction accuracy, but **decision-grade operational insight**.
